# DashButtonControl

Allows you to hack an Amazon Dash Button to control your smart lights.

On the first push, the lights will turn off. On the next push, only "dim" lights will turn on. On the third push, all the lights turn on. The cycle repeats.

By using a bit of programming, one Dash Button can control multiple devices; in this case, a power strip and a separate light strip.
